                    Hi, My name is The Mai! My first name is pronounced Tay like in Taylor. I am a full-stack developer living in Houston, TX. I graduated from the University of Houston with a Bachelors in Hospitality..
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>     Wait... so why am I here you ask? Simple! I've always been interested in Computers since a young age and I slowly realized that whenever I'm not working I'm in front of a computer. So why not do both at the same time? I love working in a team to find the best solution and the best solution is the one that makes everyone happy. I believe that a hard-work ethic and a positive mentality is the most beneficial thing a person can work to a team.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                    So towards the end of 2017 I took the first steps of my journey and starting learning how to code. After some weeks of self-learning I eventually found myself in a coding bootcamp developed by The University of Texas. I'm excited that you're here reading this because that means I'm doing something right!
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                    If you're curious about my work check out my portfolio. If you're already interested in me then head over to the Contact area to get in touch with me.
